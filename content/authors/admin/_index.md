### What is UCSB TidyTuesday?

UCSB TidyTuesday is a weekly coding club where participants code, learn, and teach together in a safe, supportive, low-stress environment. We welcome programmers and data scientists at any level, and learning or working in any language, to join us! 

### Where can you find us? 

We meet: Tuesdays (usually 5pm - 7pm!)

- October - May: weekly, at a different location on campus or nearby 
- June - September: every other Tuesday (5pm - 7pm) *remotely* on Zoom

Send us an email to receive our weekly announcement with meeting location, information and updates! 

### Why #tidytuesday?

The #tidytuesday hashtag comes from the [R for Data Science online learning community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/), which started the [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) initiative to provide coders an opportunity to skill-build and share contributions using weekly approachable datasets in *R*. The *tidy* part, in particular, refers to the [tidy data framework](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) for cleaning and organizing data. 

We welcome you to join us! Add your name to our mailing list to get updates.
